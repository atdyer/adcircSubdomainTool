/**
 * @brief This class provides a data structure that can be used to store a large number
 * of Node objects and provide very quick access to the node closest to a specific point.
 *
 * This class allows the user to store a large number of Node objects in a quadtree data
 * structure. This provides very fast lookup when the user needs to find the Node that is
 * closest to a specific point in space. Nodes are stored in bins of a specific size
 * (called leaves) based on their physical location in space. Once a leaf reaches its
 * maximum size, if another Node attempts to enter that leaf, the leaf is turned into
 * a branch. A branch has four spaces that can hold data, each of which can either be
 * a leaf or another branch. The result is a tree structure that can be quickly traversed
 * using x-y coordinates. Once a leaf has been reached in the tree traversal, a linear
 * search is done on all of the Nodes in that leaf to find the one closest to the
 * provided x-y coordinates.
 *
 * In order for this data structure to be effective, the dataset must be very large
 * and the bin size chosen such that the time spent doing a linear search at the
 * leaf level is negligible.
 *
 * The class currently has its own copy of all nodal data, which can hog a lot of memory
 * and cpu time performing a copy of a very large dataset, so a future optimization could
 * be to pass only a pointer to the existing data. This could be potentially dangerous
 * if the nodal data is modified after the Quadtree is created and before a call to
 * Quadtree::FindNode() is performed.
 *
